**Millionaire Fastlane by MJ DeMarco**

- Fastlane is the road to wealth
- Golden years as a waiting room for death
- Exponential scale vs linear scale
- Time for money sidewalk and slowlane
- Money tree
- Wealth is a process, not an event
  - The process demands sacrifices.
  - Expect risk and sacrifice.
  - Effort is a requirement. The journey is yours.
- Sidewalk, Slowlane, and Fastlane
  - Dimensions
    - Debt
    - Time
    - Education
    - Money
    - Income source
    - Wealth perception
    - Wealth equation
    - Destination
    - Control
    - Life perception
- Wealth
  - income + debt
- Financial discipline is blind to income
  - More money isn&#39;t a solution to poor financial management
- Change your mindset by changing your roadmap
- Three fundamental F&#39;s
  - Family - relationships
  - Fitness - health
  - Freedom – choice
- Looking wealth vs being wealthy
  - Wealth isn&#39;t in a car but the freedom to by the car
- Faux wealth destroys real wealth
  - Looking wealthy destroys family, fitness, and freedom
- Lifestyle servitude
  - Servitude is the antithesis of freedom
  - Consumerism is the leading obstacle to happiness
    - Money owns them instead of them owning money
  - Normal is modern day slavery
  - False prophet of feel-good – instant gratification and immediate pleasure
  - Solution is to shift from short-term thinking to long-term thinking
- Affordability is when you don&#39;t have to think about it
  - If you have to resort to mental gymnastics, then you can&#39;t afford it
- Overcome wealth impersonation, know what you can and can&#39;t afford
- Instant gratification destroys wealth, health, and choice
- Process creates events that others see as luck
- Luck is not an event but a residue of process
- Law of victims
  - External locus of control
- Accountability is culpability to consequence and modifying your behaviors to present those consequences
  - Own the mistake and learn from it
- Fastlane mindset to take responsibility then accountability
- Wealth is best lived young while you have health, vibrancy, and energy
  - In the Slowlane
    - Wealth = job + market investments = intrinsic value + compound interest
      - Intrinsic value is the value of your time set by the marketplace
  - Your soul is more than a weekend
  - People are paid freedom in currency of Saturday and Sunday
- Jobs limited in leverage and control
- A specialized skill set narrows your useful value to a confined set of marketplace needs
- Slowlane entrapment is conformity and education servitude
  - Limited choice is the name of the game
  - Slowlaners attempt to manipulate intrinsic value via education
- Sidewalker deals with lifestyle servitude and slowlaner deals with education servitude
- Gurus and financial advisors are guilty of the paradox of practice
  - Do they practice what you preach
  - Beware that you&#39;re being sold one wealth equation while the player of the game uses another
  - Their wealth comes from your belief
- Options in the Slowlane
  - Increasing hours worked
  - Changing jobs or adding jobs
  - Going back to school
  - Seeking better investment yields
  - Expanding investment time horizon
  - Increasing investments
- Personal net income = intrinsic value – personal expenses
- Exploding income and controlling expenses is what actually creates wealth. Not hoodwinking expenses.
- A millionaire isn&#39;t rich anymore, they&#39;re just a member of the upper middle class. Ten million is the old one million.
- Producer vs consumer mindset
  - To consume richly, produce richly first
- Net profit = units sold \* unit profit
- Asset value = net profit \* industry multiple
- Fastlane business seedlings
  - Rental systems
  - Computer/software systems
  - Content systems
  - Distribution systems
  - Human resource systems
- C corporation, S corporate, and LCC
- Exit strategy, growth strategy, liability exposure
- Treasonous choice
- Impact differential with choices
- Horsepower fades as you age. Maximal under 25
  - Youthful choices radiate the most strength
- Choices of perception and action
- Worst case consequence analysis
- Weighted average decision matrix
- Value your time poorly and you will be poor
- Lifespan = free time + indentured time
- Parasitic debt
- Time losers are poor evaluators of time
  - Fastlaners are frugal with time and slowlaners are frugal with money
  - Time is king
- Acquisition and application of knowledge will make you rich
- Enroll in toilet university
- Interest vs commitment
  - Sweat of success is failure
- Intelligent risks vs moronic risks
- Waiting empowers mediocrity
- Law of effection
  - To make millions you must impact millions
- Low entry businesses are weak roads
  - Easy entry creates high competition
- Saturation causes declining sales volumes
  - Declining sales causes profit erosion
- Exceptionality breaks the odds of entry
- Best warning flag is &quot;everyone&quot;
- Address the selfishness of others in business
  - Business that solves needs and provides value wins
- ASK yourself
  - IS there a need
  - Can you do it BETTER
  - What improved value can you OFFER
  - What ASSETS do you bring
- Address pain points, service gaps, unsolved problems, or emotional disconnects
- Magnitude or reach to achieve scale
  - Tiny habitats create tiny wealth
  - Pool of customers determine your habitat
- Someone is always already doing it
- Skip the big idea and go for the big execution
- Spotting open roads. When folks say things like:
  - I hate
  - I don&#39;t like
  - This frustrates me
  - Why is this like this
  - Do I have to
  - I wish there was
  - I&#39;m tired of
  - This sucks
- Financial literacy
  - Hiring a financial adviser doesn&#39;t fix financial literacy
  - Literacy gives you the power to evaluate your adviser&#39;s advice
  - Literacy is insurance
- Doing nothing is expected. Execution is everything.
- An idea is neurological flatulence, execution smells like a rose
- &quot;Me too&quot; businesses produce me-too incomes
  - Get tossed in the bin of commoditization
    - Product or service that appears homogenous among providers.
    - Like a airline ticket or car gas
- Price implies value
