**Millionaire Fastlane by MJ DeMarco**

- Fastlane is the road to wealth

- Golden years as a waiting room for death

- Exponential scale vs linear scale

- Time for money sidewalk and slowlane

- Money tree

- Wealth is a process, not an event

o The process demands sacrifices.

o Expect risk and sacrifice.

o Effort is a requirement. The journey is yours.

- Sidewalk, Slowlane, and Fastlane

o Dimensions

§ Debt

§ Time

§ Education

§ Money

§ Income source

§ Wealth perception

§ Wealth equation

§ Destination

§ Control

§ Life perception

- Wealth

o income + debt

- Financial discipline is blind to income

o More money isn't a solution to poor financial management

- Change your mindset by changing your roadmap

- Three fundamental F's

o Family - relationships

o Fitness - health

o Freedom -- choice

- Looking wealth vs being wealthy

o Wealth isn't in a car but the freedom to by the car

- Faux wealth destroys real wealth

o Looking wealthy destroys family, fitness, and freedom

- Lifestyle servitude

o Servitude is the antithesis of freedom

o Consumerism is the leading obstacle to happiness

§ Money owns them instead of them owning money

o Normal is modern day slavery

o False prophet of feel-good -- instant gratification and immediate pleasure

o Solution is to shift from short-term thinking to long-term thinking

- Affordability is when you don't have to think about it

o If you have to resort to mental gymnastics, then you can't afford it

- Overcome wealth impersonation, know what you can and can't afford

- Instant gratification destroys wealth, health, and choice

- Process creates events that others see as luck

- Luck is not an event but a residue of process

- Law of victims

o External locus of control

- Accountability is culpability to consequence and modifying your behaviors to present those consequences

o Own the mistake and learn from it

- Fastlane mindset to take responsibility then accountability

- Wealth is best lived young while you have health, vibrancy, and energy

o In the Slowlane

§ Wealth = job + market investments = intrinsic value + compound interest

- Intrinsic value is the value of your time set by the marketplace

o Your soul is more than a weekend

o People are paid freedom in currency of Saturday and Sunday

- Jobs limited in leverage and control

- A specialized skill set narrows your useful value to a confined set of marketplace needs

- Slowlane entrapment is conformity and education servitude

o Limited choice is the name of the game

o Slowlaners attempt to manipulate intrinsic value via education

- Sidewalker deals with lifestyle servitude and slowlaner deals with education servitude

- Gurus and financial advisors are guilt of the paradox of practice

o Do you practice what you preach

o Beware that you're being sold one wealth equation while the player of the game uses another

o Their wealth comes from your belief

- Options in the Slowlane

o Increasing hours worked

o Changing jobs or adding jobs

o Going back to school

o Seeking better investment yields

o Expanding investment time horizon

o Increasing investments

- Personal net income = intrinsic value -- personal expenses

- Exploding income and controlling expenses is what actually creates wealth. Not hoodwinking expenses.

- A millionaire isn't rich anymore, they're just a member of the upper middle class. Ten million is the old one million.

- Producer vs consumer mindset

o To consume richly, produce richly first

- Net profit = units sold * unit profit

- Asset value = net profit * industry multiple

- Fastlane business seedlings

o Rental systems

o Computer/software systems

o Content systems

o Distribution systems

o Human resource systems

- C corporation, S corporate, and LCC

- Exit strategy, growth strategy, liability exposure

- Treasonous choice

- Impact differential with choices

- Horsepower fades as you age. Maximal under 25

o Youthful choices radiate the most strength 

- Choices of perception and action

- Worst case consequence analysis

- Weighted average decision matrix

- Value your time poorly and you will be poor

- Lifespan = free time + indentured time

- Parasitic debt

- Time losers are poor evaluators of time

o Fastlaners are frugal with time and slowlaners are frugal with money

o Time is king

- Acquisition and application of knowledge will make you rich

- Enroll in toilet university

- Interest vs commitment

o Sweat of success is failure

- Intelligent risks vs moronic risks

- Waiting empowers mediocrity

- Law of effection

o To make millions you must impact millions

- Low entry businesses are weak roads

o Easy entry creates high competition

- Saturation causes declining sales volumes

o Declining sales causes profit erosion

- Exceptionality breaks the odds of entry

- Best warning flag is "everyone"

- Address the selfishness of others in business

o Business that solves needs and provides value wins

- ASK yourself

o IS there a need

o Can you do it BETTER

o What improved value can you OFFER

o What ASSETS do you bring

- Address pain points, service gaps, unsolved problems, or emotional disconnects

- Magnitude or reach to achieve scale

o Tiny habitats create tiny wealth

o Pool of customers determine your habitat

- Someone is always already doing it

- Skip the big idea and go for the big execution

- Spotting open roads. When folks say things like:

o I hate

o I don't like

o This frustrates me

o Why is this like this

o Do I have to

o I wish there was

o I'm tired of

o This sucks

- Financial literacy

o Hiring a financial adviser doesn't fix financial literacy

o Literacy gives you the power to evaluate your adviser's advice

o Literacy is insurance

- Doing nothing is expected. Execution is everything.

- An idea is neurological flatulence, execution smells like a rose

- "Me too" businesses produce me-too incomes

o Get tossed in the bin of commoditization

§ Product or service that appears homogenous among providers.

§ Like a airline ticket or car gas

- Price implies value
