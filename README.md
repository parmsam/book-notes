# notes-mythical-man-month

- Myth of the man-month
- Brain representation bugs
- Effort or time cost of communication
    - Training and intercommunication
- The surgical team
    - A small sharp team is best
- Conceptual integrity
- Architecture vs implementation 
    - What happens vs how it happens
- Ratio of function to conceptual integrity 
- Discipline is good for art. Form is liberating.
- Second system effect
- Tower of Babel failed due to lack of communication and organization 
- Organizations most be organized based on the people available
- Thinker-doer is the rarest
- Important of a high level language on programming efficiency
    - Reasons are productivity and debugging speed
- Representation is the essence of programming
- Documents communicate the decisions to others. Intended to keep everyone in the same direction.
- Always build a prototype and iterate off of it.
    - Leverage quantization of change
    - Power of rapid prototyping 
- Cost of maintenance of a program is 40 percent or more than the cost of development
- More users find more bugs
    - Fixing one bug often causes a new one to emerge
    - Key to have a test bank
- System program building decreases entropy and program maintenance increases entropy.
- Have one toolmaker per team
- Have a milestones schedule that you work off 
    - Can document this in a milestones report with completions tracking
- Hustle is essential 
- Boss has to distinguish between action info and status info 
    - Is this a status review meeting or problem action meeting
- Test cases go together with documentation 
    - Mainline cases
    - Barely legitimate cases
        - Ensure possible values work
    - Barely illegitimate cases
        - Invalid inputs raise proper diagnostic messages 
- Use space and formatting, prose documentation, and symbolic naming to your advantage. 
- All successful software gets changed
    - Software product is embedded in a cultural matrix of applications, users, laws, and machine vehicles
- Hardest part of building a software system is deciding precisely what to build
    - Clients usually don’t k ow what they want. They usually know what questions need to be answered, but haven’t thought the problem through into detail 
    - This, extensive iteration between the client and designer is core to the system definition
- Attack the essence 
- Writing vs building vs growing a program/system
- No silver bullet
- “Happy user” test 
- Reuse is easier to say than do. It requires good design and very good documentation 
- Good rule of thumb is that reusable components take twice the effort of a one shot component 
- User oriented program
